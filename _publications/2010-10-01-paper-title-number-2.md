This study numerically investigates the aerodynamic performance of double Savonius-type vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) equipped with a deflector, using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The performance of the proposed configuration is compared with that of conventional Savonius turbines without a deflector.

Key turbine–deflector deployment parameters are systematically analyzed, including deflector shape, deflector size, deflector-to-turbine distance, and turbine-to-turbine distance. To efficiently assess the relative importance of these design variables, the Taguchi method is employed.

The results indicate that deflector shape and turbine-to-turbine distance have a more pronounced influence on turbine performance compared to other parameters. The findings provide practical design guidelines for enhancing the performance of Savonius VAWTs through optimized deflector-assisted configurations.
